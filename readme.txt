In short, this sketch bounces OSC messages back to Osculator, routing them either to a set of Firefox commands or VLC commands. Toggling which mode (VLC/Firefox) is done by the Wiimote B button.

This repo contains the necessary OSCulator patch, Processing sketch, and Processing library. To use this, of course, you'll need to have Processing and OSCulator installed. And you'll need a Wii remote too.

Have fun, AKA
